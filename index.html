			<h1>Communication First</h1>
			<p>We believe that <span class='red'>communication is the first step</span> to understanding others, to developing a relationship, to learning about other cultures, to empathizing with others, to partnerships that will last a lifetime.</p>

			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<section class='one-third'>
				<p>When we first formed as a group, we weren't sure what we wanted to make the focus of our group. We knew we wanted to better understand individuals with a disability, but we weren't sure which group we wanted to focus on. One of our members had experience working with the DHH community, so we decided to learn more about the DHH community.</p>
			</section>
			<section class='one-third'>
				<p>At the beginning of every work session, our group decides what we need to work on for this session. We will then divide up into smaller teams and work on said tasks. We like to play music while we are working, with people taking turns to decide which song plays next.</p>
			</section>
			<section class='one-third'>
				<p>In an effort to protect the security of our team members, we will not disclose their names. We have six members currently in high school in Mountain View, California. </p>
